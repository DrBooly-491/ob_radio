## ob_radio
A script that gives you the ability to add your own radio station / songs to FiveM

## Dependencies:

### There isn't really any dependencies for this script to work however, I'd reccomend you download these tools if you want to edit songs / hud elements
* Open IV - https://openiv.com/
* CodeWalker30_dev48 - https://discord.com/invite/CR3vmYX
* Joe's Native Audio Tool - https://github.com/JoeSzymkowiczFiveM/native-audio-tool
* JPEXS - https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler 

## How to Install

### Step 1: 

Drag ox_radio from your downloads into your [standalone] folder make sure to remove the _main so the resource is ob_radio and not ob_radio_main

### Step 2:

Make sure your standalone folder is started in your server.cfg if not make sure to ensure that or ensure ob_radio

### Step 3: 

Start your server and enjoy
